# Public Rest API for AraguaneyBits (2019-05-09)
# General API Information
* The base endpoint is: **https://api.araguaneybits.com**
* All endpoints return either a JSON object or array.
* Data is returned in **descending** order. Newest first, oldest last.
* All time and timestamp related fields are in milliseconds.
* HTTP `4XX` return codes are used for for malformed requests;
  the issue is on the sender's side.
* HTTP `429` return code is used when breaking a request rate limit.
* HTTP `418` return code is used when an IP has been auto-banned for continuing to send requests after receiving `429` codes.
* HTTP `5XX` return codes are used for internal errors; the issue is on
  Binance's side.
  It is important to **NOT** treat this as a failure operation; the execution status is
  **UNKNOWN** and could have been a success.
* Any endpoint can return an ERROR; the error payload is as follows:
```javascript
{
  "code": -1121,
  "msg": "Invalid symbol."
}
```
* Specific error codes and messages defined in another document.
* For `GET` endpoints, parameters must be sent as a `query string`.
* For `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` endpoints, the parameters may be sent as a
  `query string` or in the `request body` with content type
  `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. You may mix parameters between both the
  `query string` and `request body` if you wish to do so.
* Parameters may be sent in any order.
* If a parameter sent in both the `query string` and `request body`, the
  `query string` parameter will be used.
